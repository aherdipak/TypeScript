## Introduction

1. The typescript is just extended javascript. 
2. The typescript is an open source programming language developed & maintained by Microsoft.
   It is a typed superset of javascript that compiled to pain javascript, which is understood by the browsers.
3. Javascript is dynamically typed which means javascript does not know what type of variable is, Until it is actually instantiated at runtime which is too late. Typescript on the other hand add type support to javascript as resulting errors are identified when you type your code & during the compilation steps.
4. The best part is specifying the type is completely optional.  
5. Another important reason to consider typescript is the enhanced IDE support with typescript, we get an intelligent support ability to refactor code easily.
6. Typescript is the main programming language of angular.
